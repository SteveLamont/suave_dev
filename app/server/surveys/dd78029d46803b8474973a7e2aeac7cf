Wrappings are of ivory nut palm leaf and the measuring stick, which also prevents the rickety stack from falling, is the mid-rib from the leaf. The kesa must stand freely and be neatly arranged, but the rough edges of the thin shell make this difficult. This kesa is worth five small kesa. Kesa larger than this one were given personal names, and their histories were carefully remembered and related by their owners.",still image,between 1958-1961,"Scheffler, Harold W., 1932-","Special Collections & Archives, UC San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0175 (https://lib.ucsd.edu/sca)",This digital image is a surrogate of an item from the Harold Scheffler Papers (MSS 481).,"[Title, Date].

bb22876965,atc3_m481_1_15,Standing up kesa.,Standing up kesa.,"This series shows the process of standing up kesa in order to display and measure it, as was conventional procedure in all kesa transactions. Wrappings are of ivory nut palm leaf and the measuring stick, which also prevents the rickety stack from falling, is the mid-rib from the leaf. The kesa must stand freely and be neatly arranged, but the rough edges of the thin shell make this difficult. The man in the center is the owner of this kesa, which is worth five small kesa, and he shows obvious delight in tis display. Kesa larger than this one were given personal names, and their histories were carefully remembered and related by their owners.",still image,between 1958-1961,"Scheffler, Harold W., 1932-","Special Collections & Archives, UC San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0175 (https://lib.ucsd.edu/sca)",This digital image is a surrogate of an item from the Harold Scheffler Papers (MSS 481).,"[Title, Date].

Wrappings are of ivory nut palm leaf and the measuring stick, which also prevents the rickety stack from falling, is the mid-rib from the leaf. The kesa must stand freely and be neatly arranged, but the rough edges of the thin shell make this difficult. The man in the center is the owner of this kesa, which is worth five small kesa, and he shows obvious delight in tis display. Kesa larger than this one were given personal names, and their histories were carefully remembered and related by their owners.",still image,between 1958-1961,"Scheffler, Harold W., 1932-","Special Collections & Archives, UC San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0175 (https://lib.ucsd.edu/sca)",This digital image is a surrogate of an item from the Harold Scheffler Papers (MSS 481).,"[Title, Date].

The kesa must stand freely and be neatly arranged, but the rough edges of the thin shell make this difficult. The man in the center is the owner of this kesa, which is worth five small kesa, and he shows obvious delight in tis display.

bb41307167,atc3_m481_1_11,Standing up kesa.,Standing up kesa.,"This series shows the process of standing up kesa in order to display and measure it, as was conventional procedure in all kesa transactions. Wrappings are of ivory nut palm leaf and the measuring stick, which also prevents the rickety stack from falling, is the mid-rib from the leaf. The kesa must stand freely and be neatly arranged, but the rough edges of the thin shell make this difficult.

Wrappings are of ivory nut palm leaf and the measuring stick, which also prevents the rickety stack from falling, is the mid-rib from the leaf. The kesa must stand freely and be neatly arranged, but the rough edges of the thin shell make this difficult. The man in the center is the owner of this kesa, which is worth five small kesa, and he shows obvious delight in tis display. Kesa larger than this one were given personal names, and their histories were carefully remembered and related by their owners.",still image,between 1958-1961,"Scheffler, Harold W., 1932-","Special Collections & Archives, UC San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0175 (https://lib.ucsd.edu/sca)",This digital image is a surrogate of an item from the Harold Scheffler Papers (MSS 481).,"[Title, Date].
